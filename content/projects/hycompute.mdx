HyCompute adds programmable computers to Hytale with the help of Cobalt,
a Lua interpreter for Java, written by [SquidDev](https://github.com/SquidDev-CC).

Early development of the mod focuses on adding a computer, which can
persist files and run Lua scripts. Future development will add features
such as bugs and drones - programmable entities that can move around and
perform actions based on the scripts they are running.

## Current Features

- Placeable computer block with terminal UI
- Lua scripting via Cobalt
- Virtual filesystem (`/rom`, `/home`, `/tmp`)
  - ROM is read-only
  - Home is read-write
  - Temporary files can be stored in `/tmp`
  - Currently not persistent
- Basic shell commands (ls, cd, cat, mkdir, rm, cp, mv, etc.)

## Planned features

- Tiered computers
  - Multiple tiers of computers with different capabilities
- Drone Workbench
  - A place to create and upgrade drones and bugs
- Upgradeable drones and bugs
  - Upgrades like a Mining Upgrade, which lets drones and bugs mine blocks
- More programming languages
  - Possibility of adding more interpreted languages like Python or Haskell
    via extensions

...and more! Stay tuned for more updates!
