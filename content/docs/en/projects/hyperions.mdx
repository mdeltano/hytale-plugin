**Hyperions** is an API library for Hytale that is designed to provide other mods with an API for storing, transmitting, and receiving energy. The library uses the Transfer API by community member shailist {/* TODO link */}, and is based off of the [Energy](https://github.com/TechReborn/Energy) API by the TechReborn team.

The standard unit of energy used by Hyperions is called the Hyperion (`Hy` for short), and one Hyperion is roughly equal to {/* TODO */}. The standard unit of transfer rate is the Hyperion per tick (`Hy/t`), or alternatively divide by 30 to get Hyperions per second (`Hy/s`).

## API Usage

{/* TODO */}
