## Documentation Guidelines

### File Structure

- Place documentation files in `content/docs/`
- Use kebab-case for file names: `server-first-dev.mdx`
- Organize related content in subdirectories
- Update `meta.json` files for navigation

### MDX Format

Documentation files use MDX (Markdown + JSX):

```mdx
---
title: Your Page Title
description: A brief description of the content
---

## Introduction

Your content here...
```

### Content Guidelines

1. **Accuracy First**
   - Verify information against official Hytale sources
   - Link to [official blog posts](https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-modding-strategy-and-status) when relevant
   - Clearly mark speculation or unconfirmed information

2. **Clear and Concise**
   - Write for your audience (beginners to advanced)
   - Use simple language where possible
   - Break complex topics into digestible sections
   - Include code examples and screenshots

3. **Well-Structured**
   - Use proper heading hierarchy (h2, h3, h4)
   - Include a table of contents for long pages
   - Add cross-references to related pages
   - Use callouts for important notes

4. **Code Examples**
   - Provide complete, working examples
   - Include comments explaining key concepts
   - Follow Java and JSON best practices
   - Test your code before submitting

## Submitting Changes

### Branch Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your changes:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

2. Make your changes and commit:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add clear, descriptive commit message"
```

3. Push to your fork:
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

4. Open a Pull Request on GitHub

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Title**: Clear and descriptive (e.g., "Add Java plugin tutorial" or "Fix typo in quick-start guide")
- **Description**: Explain what changes you made and why
- **Link Issues**: Reference related issues with `Fixes #123` or `Relates to #456`
- **Screenshots**: Include before/after screenshots for visual changes
- **Testing**: Confirm the site builds and renders correctly

### Commit Messages

Follow these conventions:
- Use present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Use imperative mood: "Fix bug" not "Fixes bug"
- Keep first line under 72 characters
- Add detailed description if needed

Examples:
```
Add server plugin development guide

Fix broken link in quick-start documentation

Update data assets section with JSON examples
```

## Style Guide

### Markdown Styling

- Use `**bold**` for emphasis
- Use `*italic*` for slight emphasis
- Use `code` for inline code, file names, and commands
- Use code blocks with language tags:

```java
public class ExamplePlugin {
    // Your code here
}
```

### Writing Style

- Write in second person (you/your) when addressing readers
- Use active voice
- Keep sentences concise
- Use lists for multiple items
- Add examples to illustrate concepts

### Technical Terms

- **Hytale**: Always capitalize
- **Blockbench**: Capitalize as proper noun
- **Java**: Capitalize (programming language)
- **JSON**: All caps
- **MDX**: All caps

### Links

- Use descriptive link text (not "click here")
- Link to official Hytale sources when possible
- Use relative links for internal pages: `[Quick Start](/docs/quick-start)`
